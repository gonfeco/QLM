'''
In this program we want to use Grover search combined with phase estimation to perform an amplitude estimation.
This algorithm is exactly the same as quantum counting but in this case theta encodes the expected value that we want to compute.

a      (float)    : lower bond of the interval
b      (float)    : upper bond of the interval
nqbits (int)      : number of qubits that will be used for discretizing and encoding our probability distribution
p      (function) : probability distribution that will be loaded. Must be positive and will be normalized automatically 
f      (function) : function for which the expectation value will be computed. Its image must be restricted to the interval [0, 1]
n_aux  (int)      : Number of qubits in the register used to calculate the Fourier transform

The eigenvalues of the Grover operator are e^{\pm i*2*\theta}
Here, we are implementing the operator -Q, not Q. Tipically this is regarded
as a global phase, but when controlling that operator it is not. 
That - sign is just the same as considering that the operator is not marking the states that we are looking for, but rather the states that we are nor looking for.
Thus, we can consider that the eigenvalues of our implemented operator are e^{\pm i*2*\psi} with
\ket{\psi} = \cos{(phi)} \ket{\psi_1} + \sin{(\phi)} \ket{\psi_0}.
Obviously, \theta and \phi are related bu \phi = \theta + \pi, rememeber that the integral is codified in the amplitudes of \ket{\psi_1}
All in all we will be computing the angle \phi as 2*\phi = 2*pi*measured_value/2^{n_aux}
