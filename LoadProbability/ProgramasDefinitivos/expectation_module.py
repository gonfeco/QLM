The objective of this module is to initialize a quantum state codifying a probability distribution.
The best way to do this is to codify directly the square root of the probabilities in the quantum amplitudes,
as if it was an histogram.
Then, the function load_function will allow us to load a function on those probabilities using an auxiliary qubit;
the function will be codified on those qubits in which that qubit's value is 1
After that, we can create the Grover operator Q
