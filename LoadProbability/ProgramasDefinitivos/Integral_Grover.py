'''
In this program we want to use Grover search to compute an expectation value.
This process will have 4 steps. First, load the probability distribution using nqbits qubits.
Then, load the function for which we want to compute the expectation value.
After that has been done, create the Grover operation and apply it k times
Finally, simulate the circuit and try to get the result

a      (float)    : lower bond of the interval
b      (float)    : upper bond of the interval
nqbits (int)      : number of qubits that will be used for discretizing and encoding our probability distribution
p      (function) : probability distribution that will be loaded. Must be positive and will be normalized automatically 
f      (function) : function for which the expectation value will be computed.
k      (int)      : number of times that the Grover operation will be applied
